# SECJ1013-Programming-Technique-1

<h2>Course summary</h2>
This subject was taught by Dr Nies Hui Wen. As a fundamental subject, this course equips the students with theory and practice on problem solving techniques by using the structured approach. Students are required to develop programs using C++ programming language, in order to solve simple to moderate problems. The course covers the following: pre-processor directives, constants and variables, data types, input and output statements, control structures: sequential, selection and loop, built-in and user-defined functions, single and two dimensional arrays, file operations, pointers, and structured data types.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
We learnt the basics of C++ in this class. C++ is a bit hard complexity, but it is versatile and has a good performance. Learning the basics of programming provides a valuable skill set and knowledge base that can greatly when implemented when creating programs.I could improve by doing more program exercises and eventually try doing bigger projects in order to gain full understanding of the programming language.
